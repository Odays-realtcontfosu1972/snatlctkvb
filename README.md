Damn. Last Breath... where do I even begin? Just walked out, still a bit hazy from that sound assault and my back's kind of protesting from those awful seats. So loud. My ears are ringing louder than that time the rooster decided to crow at midnight. Seriously, man, you gotta remind me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later — if only to figure out what the hell just happened.

Okay, so picture this. One minute, you're right there in the quiet fields, smelling the hay — not the actual hay, mind you, but it's like you smell it, you know? Then bam! The protagonist's gasping for air in the middle of nowhere. Air cut short like when the tractor wouldn't start and you think you'll never get through the plowing before dark. I thought about the popcorn, salty as a forgotten field of tears. It’s stuck in my teeth, just like trying to recall each scene is stuck in my brain right now.

The villain — or was it just a symbol or something? — had this grin that could scare a scarecrow. This scene where they chase each other. Like chasing chickens on a rainy day... feathers, chaos, slipping mud, the whole shebang. 

> Somehow, amidst all the chaos, there’s this melody. Feels almost like an old windmill creaking in the evening — kind of comforting, but you know it’s about to fall apart if you don’t fix it soon. The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing too — an ice box! Made me think of the winter 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦ze from last 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯. The actor’s eyes, man, reminded me of those headlights you catch flickering, turning on the tractor late at night.

Oh, almost forgot — you mentioned 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , right? Yeah, def need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again. 'Cause are you supposed to feel like you’re drowning in it? Water everywhere — dripping, flowing, roaring. I thought I saw the plot but it zoomed away like a rabbit running from a hawk.

The ending though. Blurred like the horizon line when storms start brewing. I didn't know if I was baffled or just hungry... should've skipped the medium popcorn, stuck with small. And I couldn’t help but chuckle, nervously, when the character said something about life being like a tangled piece of yarn.

Sooo... yeah, I think I’ll go back. And maaybe that goose from the lake is their spirit guide. Or something. My head hurts, but maybe that's cuz my back is still sore.
